# terminalCalculator
this is a terminal calculator --- designed in python with least scripts --- works as well as the android calculators but in terminal environment --- just fo fun folks

To use this code as in a pc --- one must have python3_(coded in python3.8.3)

The given code can be interpreted in both usual method of

1.Terminal command of python as :
  
  $python3 calci.py
  
2.Or one can use hashbang method (installing app for recurrent permanent use):(for linux machines)
  *must have python3 installed in /usr/bin/python3 directory in a linux machine _one can alter this piece of code at the top of the file to the default location
  *file once cloned must be converted to executable --- for this go to the cloned directory (terminalCalculator)
  
  $cd terminalCalculator
  
  $chmod +x calci.py
 
  
  as the file turns as an executable snippet on the pc --- one can directly run it as any application in terminal without invoking python3 compiler every time
  -
  eg:
    $./calci.py
